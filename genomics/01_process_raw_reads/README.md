The `process_reads.yml` describes a conda environment needed to perform the analysis described in the snakemake pipelines. Our sequencing was performed in multiple sequencing batches, with one pipleline for each set of sequencing. The snakemake files present the code we used to analyze our data, but would likely need to be modified to run properly on a different computer using the raw data downloaded from NCBI SRA (as the folder/file structure will be different).
