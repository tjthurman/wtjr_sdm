# Template config file for:
# angsd_window_fst.smk
# Calculates slinding-window Fst between two populations
# Assumes populations have already had .saf files calculated with the 
# the angsd_GL_genome_wide.smk pipeline

# Batch names
# A short name to give for a given analysis batch.
# the batch names for the populations should match the batch names used
# for creating the .saf files
# The batch name for the Fst file should be new and unique to the analysis set
# by analysis set, I mean the set of previous analyses and filters
# One could run this pipeline multiple tim
