The `fst.yml` file describes a conda environment needed to perform the estimation of genome-wide Fst between Colorado and North Dakota samples. This requires a few steps. First, the `angsd_GL_genome_wide.sml` pipeline is run twice, once for each population. There are two corresponding snakemake configuration files: one for the Colorado population and one for the North Dakota population. Next, the `angsd_window_fst.smk` pipeline looks estimates the 2d-SFS and estimates Fst across each scaffold. Then, use the `print_Fst_for_genome_wide.sh` script to compile the per-scaffold Fst results into one file. Finally, use the `genome_wide_Fst.R` script to calculate genome-wide Fst. These files show the code used in our analysis, but they will need to be modified (mostly by modifying paths) to run on a different computer.
